#  Background


You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel master! For this task, you will use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. Depending on your comfort level with VBA, you may choose to challenge yourself with a few of the challenge tasks.

# Instructions

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year for each run and take the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

# Challenges

1. Your solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume". 

2. Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
